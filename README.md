# EquityMagnet

### About app:
This is the final project for my  Python Backend ogramming course. This website gives the user access to the companies' data. The data is from financialmodelingprep.com API. The key functionality of the app, is the evaluation of a chosen company. Users can access discounted cash flow evaluation to which they can insert crucial determinants as WACC, g, revenues & costs rates and tax, and then see the results as well as calculations.

### Home screen:
On the home screen there are generated 4 boxes with random companies from the database. From here you can redirect to search screen, watchlist, evaluations, to your profile, or you can log in/log out. You can also go to companies detail. Generated boxes have a link in them.

### Searching for a company:
Filers are autogenerated according to database. You can also search and sort data, that is displayed over several pages. Companies can be added to favorites by clicking the icon to left. However, this functionality requires being logged in. Filled icon indicates that a company has already been added to favorites. Every company name is a link to its details.
