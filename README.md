### About app:
This is the final project for my programming course. This website gives the user access to the companies' data. The data is from financialmodelingprep.com API. The key functionality of the app, is the evaluation of a chosen company. Users can access discounted cash flow evaluation to which they can insert crucial determinants as WACC, g, revenues & costs rates and tax, and then see the results.

### Home screen:
On the home screen there are generated 4 boxes with random companies from the database. From here you can redirect to search screen, watchlist, evaluations, to your profile, or you can log in/log out. You can also go to companies detail since generated boxes have a link in them.
